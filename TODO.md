# TODO
## Features
[x] Find suitable encoding for text and create Database class.
[x] Implement a basic FFNN for binary classification.
[ ] Implement a basic 1d CNN to leverage spacial proximity of words and reduce number of params.
[x] Create a notebook to compare the models
[x] Add early stopping with validation set
[ ] add k-folds
[ ] Add regularization techniques such as L1

## Methodology
[x] Create WandB project to log runs.

## Extra mile
[ ] Instead of using solely the message, we can use the other fields such as username/id or date (extract features such as weekday, month, time of day) in our classifier.
